# EtheriumTokenICO
This project I will create 2 smart contracts on Ethereum blockchian using Truffle Framework, Ganache. Tools that I will be using: Sublime Text 3, Ganache, Truffle Framework, Node.js, MetaMask Chrome Extension, https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ethereum. 

1 contract will create the Token called BeitCoin. 2nd contract will allow users to basically participate in an ICO (send Ether, receive Tokens, Check the Amount of Token they have)
